Before your pull request is reviewed and merged, make sure you

- [ ] there are no linting/build errors -- `npm run build`
- [ ] code is in uniquely-named feature branch, and has been rebased on top of latest master. If you're asked to make more changes make sure you rebase onto master then too!
- [ ] pull request is descriptively named and links to an issue number, i.e. `Fixes #123`

Thank you!
